## E-ink newspaper that uses NFC to update each morning.
Prevents constantly being on phone as soon as you wake up. Preferences are programmed into microcontroller to display a page that shows important stuff first like weather, daily activities etc, followed by news stories on the next few pages.
NFC could transmit image files after being compiled in the main controller to save on weight in the actual e-reader. Battery should last a long time and wouldn't be a concern on the main controller as it could be plugged in. All hardware would be the same scenario including wifi, preferences, etc.
